🇸🇱 Salone Culture App
📱 Overview

Salone Culture App is a modern Android mobile application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app showcases the arts, culture, traditions, and heritage of Sierra Leone through a clean, intuitive, and culturally themed user interface.

The project extends an official open-source Jetpack Compose sample, demonstrating effective software reuse, clean architecture, and best practices in modern Android development.

🎯 Objectives

Promote Sierra Leone’s cultural heritage digitally

Apply modern Android development with Jetpack Compose

Demonstrate MVVM architecture and clean code principles

Reuse and extend an open-source Jetpack Compose project

Produce an academic-standard mobile application

Base Open-Source Project

This app extends official Jetpack Compose Samples, such as:

JetNews – article-based storytelling and structured content

Now in Android – modern architecture and scalable navigation

These samples provide:

Material Design 3

Jetpack Navigation

ViewModel + State management

Clean architecture foundations


Architecture

The application follows the Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) pattern:

UI (Jetpack Compose)
   ↓
ViewModel (State & Logic)
   ↓
Repository (Data Layer)
   ↓
Local Data Source

This ensures scalability, testability, and maintainability.
